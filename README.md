# SimpleNN â€“ Neural Network from Scratch with NumPy

SimpleNN is a lightweight and modular artificial neural network (ANN) framework built entirely using NumPy. It supports essential neural network components including dense layers, activation functions, loss functions, and backpropagation.

##  Features

- Fully connected `Dense` layers
- Common activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax
- Loss functions: MSE, Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Backpropagation and weight updates with learning rate
- Forward and backward pass implementation
- Model saving and loading with `.npz` format
- Custom training loop with logging
